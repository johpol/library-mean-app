# Introduction
This is a library application that allows the end user to keep track of their own books. The application accepts a ten digit ISBN as input, fetches the information using a web service and stores that information in persistent storage. The list is then displayed to the user with the option to remove the book from their collection. This is implemented as a single page application providing the user with a seamless and snappy experience.
